# Quadruped Solver
This repository is the code for a class project at Carnegie Mellon University in Omptimal Control and Reinforcement Learning. The repository is a Julia implmentation of two solvers for a quadruped. The first is a convex solver modeled after the MIT cheetah controller. The second is a nonlinear solver that makes few assumptions.
